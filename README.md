About Lingual Lookup,

This is a single page React application for a basic English dictionary. The user searches for an English word and clicks the desired part of speech of the word. They also can see examples of usage, synonyms and antonyms if they are present in the database.

I have utilised from React.js, Typescript, Axios and Tailwind for the project. I chose these technologies for the project because I wanted to sharpen my skills with React, learn and practise with Typescript. Axios seemed like a good choice for getting the API results because it converts data to JSON format directly, has built-in XSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), and allows cancelling requests and request timeouts. To style, I used Tailwind to try out, React can be used in conjunction with Tailwind. I also utilised from the Free Dictionary API (https://dictionaryapi.dev/).

My app unfortunately does not give all meanings of heteronymous words at the moment, the API was sometimes hard to follow. I hope to implement it in the future.
